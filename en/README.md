#WTR- Wifi to Radio Module

---

## Summary:

WTR is a new forwarding module applied to UAV ground station WIFI revolution data transmission by CUAV. It converts terrestrial end-to-end data into wireless WIFI data and implements computer or mobile WIFI wireless connection to drones instead of traditional ones. Bluetooth transfer module for higher reliability and convenience

### Wireless Forwarding Internet

In the case of special drone operations, long-distance communication links are often required, while traditional long-distance digital transmissions can only be connected to the computer through wired communication. This will make operators very vulnerable when temporarily setting up terrestrial communication stations. constraint.

After WTR is used, these problems never return. WTR converts the digital TTL signal at the ground end into a WIFI signal and connects it through a mobile phone or a computer so that the ground data can be directly set at a high place, thus the UAV communication distance. Farther and more stable.

### Support multiple devices

WTR can convert TTL signals into WIFI hotspots and forward and receive them through UPD to support simultaneous connection of computers and mobile phones.

### Built-in fault tolerance algorithm

In practical applications, when the signal is not ideal, it is easy to produce incomplete and disordered data.

The WTR module has a high-performance Mavlink flight data checksum and fault tolerance algorithm built in, and uses the algorithm to process the received and sent data twice, avoiding incomplete data and data errors.
